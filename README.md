# New-Homepage
<p>Hi and thankyou for checking out this repository</p>
<p>I completed this frontend mentor challenge with only using grid, no flexbox just for the sake of challenging myself and improving my experience with grid.
(ofcourse i wouldn't do this in a real job project)</p>
<p>Here, a live version so can see how it looks or find some of many bugs it may have</p>
